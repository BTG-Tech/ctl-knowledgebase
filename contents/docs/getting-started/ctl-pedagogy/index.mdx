Goal Based Learning  is founded on the principles that the best way to teach is by placing students in situations that require the 
construction of both knowledge and context to achieve the required goal. Understanding by design (UBD) is a Goal Based Framework 
based on Contextual Teaching and Learning that is student centered and focuses on student understanding and their ability to apply 
their understanding. UBD uses backward design principles by first focusing on how students will be assessed and then designing 
curriculum based on how students will be assessed. The components of Goal Oriented Learning are:

1. The learning goals
    - Processing Knowledge
    - Content knowledge that focuses on the developing of the students skill set needed to reach the goal.
2. The mission
    - Set a realistic goal that requires the students to construct new knowledge and develop skills to reach the learning goal.
3. The cover story
    - Set a scenario or give background information that allows students opportunities to practice and develop their skills while pursuing 
        the knowledge stated in the learning goal.
4. The role
    - Assign a role that both motivates and provides context while helping the students practice the necessary skills to reach their learning goal.
5. The scenario operations
    - consists of all of the activities that the students to complete the mission and reach the learning goals.
6. The resources 
    - consist of any provided feedback, coaching, consequenses of actions, and any expert advice, stories, or presentations pertaining to the experience.

Inquiry Based Learning  or Situation Based Learning is based on Piaget's cognitive development principles. Inquiry Based Learning enables and encourages students to 
internalize major topics, be curious, confront and analyze preconceptions and misconceptions in a safe environment. Inquiry Based Learning  or Situation Based Learning 
is based on Piaget's cognitive development principles. Inquiry Based Learning enables and encourages students to internalize major topics, be curious, confront and analyze 
preconceptions and misconceptions in a safe environment. Inquiry Based Learning process consists of:
1. Phase 1 Exploration
- requires students to use prior knowledge and experiences to solve a problem or series of problems presented in a simulation or game that examines the concepts to be 
developed throughout the learning cycle.
2. Phase 2 Discussion and Presentation of New Content
- students share their proposed solutions, describe conflicts they experienced and strategies they used to gain consensus, and the teacher introduces new content relative 
to the issue. During the discussion. the whole class scrutinizes each solution according to logic and mutual benefits tests.
3. Application and Expansion
- Requires students to apply the knowledge, skills, and insights acquired in phase 1 and 2 to a new situation or to creatively extend their knowledge into new areas of 
exploration. Each group develops its alternative solutions to a new problem, and the learning cycle ends with the whole class coming to a consunsus as to the best solutions offered. 
 
### Project Based Learning

Project Based Learning is pedagogically based on constructivist learning and facilitated in an environment representative of Kolb's learning cycle. The purpose of Project Based Learning is to help students draw on prior experience and knowledge, while building on their experience students construct new knowledge that is action oriented and socially relevant. Project Base Learning takes place in five steps:
1. Students select a topic and form groups.
2. Students plan their project and present to one another.
3. Students engage in weekly meetings where they report on work completed, discuss their learning, and plan for the upcoming week.
4. Prepare and conduct an agogic moment where the outcomes of the project is presented to the commissioning organization
5. Prepare a comprehensive report on the project and participate in a collective evaluation process, involving all students in the group and relevant academic staff.
